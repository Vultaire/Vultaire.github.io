<p>Just finished version 0.3 of JBLite.  The big new feature: KANJIDIC2 support.</p>
<p>KANJIDIC2 support was present before, but it was based upon the external jbparse library.  Now, it's converted very similarly to JMdict.</p>
<p>Now that both of these dictionaries are converted, perhaps I can hook them into J-Ben 2 and drop the jbparse library entirely...</p>
