<p>Mostly this is documentation for myself.  Not sure this will be helpful to others...</p>
<p>Got Linux testing up on my laptop again.  Running in Gnome 3, was getting some graphical glitches, so I made a video.  (By the way, ctrl-alt-shift-R is Gnome 3's built-in way of starting/stopping a screencast recording... very convenient, the video is placed in your home directory.)</p>
<p>Basically, running an nVidia 8600M GT, and I believe this is one of the recalled chips from a few years back.  I unfortunately found out too late and don't think there is anything I can or could have done about it...  Anyway, aside from running hot, it generally works okay, although it likes to glitch or lock up when doing moderate gaming.</p>
<p>This may be totally a hardware issue, but considering how easily I can cause the glitch and that I don't need to even put any real load on the system, I'm not completely sure.  Then again, Windows XP doesn't use compositing whereas Gnome 3 does by default...</p>
