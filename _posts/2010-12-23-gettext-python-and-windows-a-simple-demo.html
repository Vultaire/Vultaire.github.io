<p>Last time, I discussed some of the issues about localizing a Python app in Windows.  This time, I'm providing a simple demo app which shows how localization can be accomplished.</p>
<p>To avoid an overly verbose explanation, I've set up a <a href="https://github.com/Vultaire/gettext_python_windows_demo">GitHub repo</a> with the code, a sample .po file, plus some scripts for easily creating .po/.mo files in the correct hierarchies.  (Consider its contents as public domain.)</p>
<p>Basically: MinGW/Msys provide the necessary utilities for extracting strings and compiling .mo files.  If you're in a non-English environment, things may act odd if LANG is not set appropriately, but other than that the tools work fine.  So, it's just a matter of a few minor tweaks, and maybe some scripts or Makefiles to automate things.</p>
<p>The demo app in the above repo contains a minimum of magic: it will check if gettext-compatible environment settings are set (LANG, LC_MESSAGES, etc.), and if not, will create a LANG value based on locale.getdefaultlocale().</p>
<p>Anyway, test output on my system (Japanese Windows with English set via Regional Settings dialog) looks like follows:</p>
<p>LANG/LC_* unspecified:</p>
<p>[sourcecode]<br />
$ ./simple_test.py<br />
Current locale:<br />
LANGUAGE None<br />
LC_ALL None<br />
LC_MESSAGES None<br />
LANG None</p>
<p>Adjusted locale:<br />
LANGUAGE None<br />
LC_ALL None<br />
LC_MESSAGES None<br />
LANG en_US</p>
<p>Hello world!<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>LANG=ja:</p>
<p>[sourcecode]<br />
$ LANG=ja ./simple_test.py<br />
Current locale:<br />
LANGUAGE None<br />
LC_ALL None<br />
LC_MESSAGES None<br />
LANG ja</p>
<p>こんにちは、世界！<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>And a final note: last time I made comments about encodings, but it seems that LANG values including encodings ("ja_JP.euc-jp") don't have any effect - at least in this demo and on Windows.  Just the language/country portion is sufficient.</p>
