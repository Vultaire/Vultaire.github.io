<p>I've basically long abandoned this site aside from some minor coding experiments here and there.  Lots of broken links, etc.  But I think it's time to bring it back in at least a minimal capacity.</p>
<p>I went through and fixed most of my old content, however most visitors likely do not care about this; if you wish to see it, visit <a href="/old_index.php">/old_index.php</a>.  Main things there are my old Japanese dictionary project, a Dvorak layout for Japanese 106-key keyboards, and my old blog from 2006-2008 from the first two years I lived in Japan.</p>
<p>I think the main point of this site now is as a technical blog, and that's the tack I'll try to pursue.  My next post is already planned, hopefully some of you out there struggling with picking up Erlang may find it useful.</p>
<p>Until then...</p>
