<p>I haven't written anything in awhile, so I figured I'd do so.  I did say I may be busy with my Japanese studies, and I expect this to be moreso the case in the future, so this blog may grow a little stagnant until after the Japanese Language Proficiency Test on December 2nd.</p>
<p>However, I have been working on some new stuff for the software.  It started with just a few updates but has lead to several significant feature additions and many under-the-hood changes to improve memory usage.  There's enough new stuff to justify increasing the minor version number rather than just the revision number.</p>
<p>It may yet be a few more weeks before it gets released, but the next version of the software will definitely be worth looking out for.</p>
