<p>It is done, at last.　Yesterday I finished taking the Level 2 Japanese Language Proficiency Test.　Did I pass?　I'd say maybe I have a 25% chance.　I've been studying like mad over the past week, and I think my strongest area may have been my kanji and vocabulary (thanks to using J-Ben as a study tool).　Reading and grammar I think I did better on since I've done some practice tests and bought a book for studying grammar, though I'm not sure I met the 60% mark for this part.　My fear however is that my listening portion was weak; during my last practice test I managed 66% but this time I think it fell below 60%.　Anyway, it's done with, the stress is largely off my shoulders, and now I can work on other things.　Of course, whether I pass or fail I intend to continue my Japanese studies, just at a less breakneck pace.</p>
<p>On today's agenda, I will be doing some well-overdue updates on J-Ben.　I expect a minor update within the next few days, fixing the J-E/E-J multibyte search bug (done by converting the dictionary files to UTF-8) as well as a few other minor mistakes.</p>
