<p><a href="http://www.vultaire.net/software/jben/" title="J-Ben Japanese study software">J-Ben</a> is an aid for studying Japanese. Its focus is primarily on kanji (the Chinese characters used in Japanese writing), and it provides tools for looking up and studying kanji. It will eventually work as a Japanese-English/English-Japanese dictionary and will help with studying vocabulary as well.</p>
<p>Version 1.0.0, the first public release, is out and available on the <a href="http://www.vultaire.net/software/jben/" title="J-Ben Japanese study software">J-Ben page</a>.  It is available for both Windows and Linux.</p>
<p>Please feel free to post comments or questions about the software here.  For private communications, check my <a href="http://www.vultaire.net/contact.php" title="Vultaire.net contact page">contact page</a>.</p>
<p>(Note: J-Ben was formerly referred to as wxKanji, and before that, JKanji.)</p>
