<p>Greetings everyone!</p>
<p>I've just started using WordPress for blogging purposes.  This should make writing updates a little easier (maybe), but more importantly it'll allow visitors to leave feedback.</p>
<p>It took way too long for me to realize that this was the right thing to do.  I'm a software engineer, and I like to code.  And I've rewritten my share of wheels, <em>when it's been suitable to do so,</em> such as when I'm teaching myself the ins and outs of a new programming language or something.  However, rewriting a large piece of software like a decent blog management system is just more work than I want to do.  I know how to do it, so unless I think that there's a real driving reason not to build off of something someone else has done and made available for free, I shouldn't waste my time.  For some people, their web site is their main project, but for me it's just a medium to explain about the things I am working on which I'm more interested in.</p>
<p>So, finally Paul has come to his senses a little bit.  About time.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates.</p>
