<p>I'm sure there's other solutions out there, but I'll share mine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a directory on your system and add it to your path.  In my case, I use C:\scripts.</li>
<li>Create a script, cyghere.bat, as follows (assuming cygwin is installed to C:\cygwin):<br />
[code title="cyghere.bat"]<br />
start C:\cygwin\bin\mintty.exe -i /Cygwin-Terminal.ico --exec /bin/bash<br />
[/code]
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, you can launch a cygwin shell from basically any program that lets you launch subprocesses.  Most common for myself is either the Windows command prompt or Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>Tip: if you have a folder open via Windows Explorer and you want to "cygwin here", press Alt-D to jump to the location bar, then type "cyghere" and press Enter.  This also works!</p>
<p>For a right-click option to open a folder via Cygwin, I defer to the rest of the Internet. :-)  With the above, I generally don't need the right-click option.</p>
