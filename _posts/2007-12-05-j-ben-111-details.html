<p>Over the last two days I've finished a series of bug fixes for J-Ben, addressing the multibyte search issue, a previously unknown infinite loop bug, and some other minor issues.  I'm getting ready for a new release, which I think will be out within the next few days.</p>
<p>However, I think there's one more feature I want to add to that release, and that is making the English-Japanese search recognize English word boundaries.  This will not affect Japanese-English searching; I may add restrictions in the future like 2-or-more kana on kana-only searches, but for the time being I don't think it's terribly necessary.</p>
<p>One last detail: I am pushing my code to a public git repository now.  Repository details are listed at http://repo.or.cz/w/jben.git.  Do I have a real serious reason why I chose git as opposed to CVS/SVN?  Honestly, just that I would like to learn how to use git properly since it is what is used for Linux kernel development, and I've been curious how different it is from CVS/SVN.</p>
<p>That's it for now.  Oh, if anyone reading this checks out my <a href="http://www.vultaire.net/japanblog/">Japan blog</a>, I uploaded about 11 months worth of photos and videos to the <a href="http://www.vultaire.net/japanblog/media/">media</a> section last night.</p>
