<p>For any friends or family who have not heard directly, here is the personal update I promised before the new year.</p>
<p>Yukari and I are now officially engaged!  It happened as of December 23, 2009.</p>
<p>Further, yesterday was the third anniversary of the day we became a couple.  Pretty cool, but of course, it's myself who's talking. ;-)</p>
