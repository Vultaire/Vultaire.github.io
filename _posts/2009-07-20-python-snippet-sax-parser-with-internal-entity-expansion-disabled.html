<p>This was a rough problem.  I'm using Python's SAX modules for parsing JMdict, and ran into a problem regarding its use of XML entities.  Nothing wrong with JMdict, but the expansion is rather verbose and does not lend itself well to what I'm doing.  I don't want "word containing irregular kanji usage", but rather, I want the "iK" code.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the default ExpatParser doesn't have a clear way to disable this.  But if you read the docs closely enough, you can find out about setting a "default handler" for it, which has the side effect of disabling internal expansion.</p>
<p>This isn't a perfect fix, but here's the class I used to get this done:</p>

<pre lang="python">
# Code is Copyright 2009 by Paul Goins
# Released into the public domain - but let me know if this is useful!

from xml.sax.expatreader import ExpatParser

class ExpatParserNoEntityExp(ExpatParser):

    """An overridden Expat parser class which disables entity expansion."""

    def reset(self):
        ExpatParser.reset(self)
        self._parser.DefaultHandler = self.dummy_handler

    def dummy_handler(self, *args, **kwargs):
        pass
</pre>
<p>So, use an instance of this class instead of one by xml.sax.make_parser (or xml.sax.parse, for that matter).  Then, in your xml.sax.handler.ContentHandler, specify a handler for skippedEntry(self, name), since that's where your internal entities are going to pop up.  By the way, built-ins such as &amp;amp; and &amp;lt; still seem to be parsed; at least in the case of JMdict it seems to just affect the parsing of the inline DTD.</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone!</p>
