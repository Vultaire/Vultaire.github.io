<p>Okay, I've moved back to GoDaddy again for hosting (as also mentioned on the <a href="/sitenews">site news</a> page).  I'm going to see about redoing this default WordPress theme into one which fits with the "no frills" rest of my site, and then keep the static pages for content like my programs.  I'm also thinking of adding phpbb forums for support/discussion, although I concede that's probably overkill; and also I think I may update my <a href="/japanblog/media">Japan Blog media page</a> with some sort of media management system, a photo album program or something.  The simpler I can make this site to manage and the more interactiveness I can add with little/no work from myself, the better.</p>
<p>That's all for now.  It's late, but I'm hungry and want to get a bite to eat before the <a href="http://www.ospn.jp/osc2009-kansai/">OSC2009 Kansai</a> conference tomorrow.</p>
